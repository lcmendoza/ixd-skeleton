Moood
====

When messaging people online, do you ever misinterpret their words and intentions? So, you might want to communicate certain emotions, but canâ€™t express them without feeling uncomfortable. Instead, you might want support from friends to do so. Our team has developed a social app for college students called Moood, where they can share their current mood by setting an avatar for it, log their thoughts and emotions, and message friends to uplift and support each other to become mindful of their emotional state.
